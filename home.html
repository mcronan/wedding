					It is going to take place in Puebla state, in the city of Cholula, about 40-50minutes drive from Puebla City which is Erika’s hometown.
					
					The venue:
					Villas Arequeològicas Cholula
					Calle 2 Poniente #601
					San Andrés Cholula, Puebla, Mexico

				<p> 
					Erika is from Puebla city, which is the capital of Puebla state. The city has a population of 1,5m people. Like any city there are more things to do, shopping, museums etc although because it is a big city, things are not within walking distance so you will need to get taxis to get around. 
					It is also more expensive to stay in than Cholula. If you are planning on staying in Puebla, get in touch with Erika on Facebook (or erikaencinas@yahoo.de) to make sure you are not staying in a dodgy area! It takes about 40-50minutes to drive from Puebla to Cholula.
					Puebla city centre is nice to see for a day or two, but we would recommend you don’t spend much more time than this there, and instead go out to other parts of Puebla state or Mexico and see the historical sites and amazing natural scenery.

				<h3 class="subtitle"> Cholula </h3> 
				<p> 
					Is Cholula expensive?
					No :)
					Of course how much you should budget depends on your spending habits, but good news: as an oil producer and dependent on what happens in the USA, the Mexican peso is in its worst shape ever and it does not seem that will get better any soon. This means that when you come you will have more Mexican pesos to spend for each unit of your currency! 
					A 330 ml beer in a restaurant will cost you approx. MXN 30 (USD 1.8). <br><br>
					A bottle of water 1 lt. in a 7 Eleven will be around MXN 15 (USD 0.9) You never drink tap water in mexico, never!
					Lunch/dinner in a restaurant will cost you approx. MXN 150 (USD 9). <br><br>
					Public transport in Puebla (buses) are not an option, so you will depend on taxis, but they are nowhere near as expensive as in Europe; it is all about the distance you will travel, but within Cholula a trip could not go any more than MXN 100 (USD 6) and they normally accommodate up to 4 people. As mentioned before, make sure you take safe cabs that are those recommended by your hotel or Uber.

				<h2 class="subtitle"> Accommodation </h2> 
				<p> 
					We recommend that you stay in <strong>Cholula, Puebla. </strong> It is a small but vivid, young, and multicultural city as it hosts one of the most important universities in Puebla.
					Cholula has many hotels options that can accommodate any budget. Most of them will start with a standard double bedroom fare and will allow you to add extra guests for a small fee so you only have to get in contact with them and ask about it. <br>
		<h3>A few suggestions:</h3>
				</p>
					<a href="https://www.villasarqueologicas.com.mx/cholula-puebla.html"><h4>Villas Arqueològicas Cholula </h4></a><p> This is the place where the celebration will take place. When calling them directly, mention you are attending our event there you should be entitled to a discount. The fare is approx. MXN 950 per night in a double bedroom (USD 58).
				</p>
				
					<a href="http://www.hotelrealdenaturales.com/Secciones.aspx?Id=6"><h4>Hotel Real de Naturales </h4></a> <p>This hotel is in the heart of Cholula, close to everything and less expensive, around MXN 650 in a double room (USD 40). They also have family suites with two bedrooms and a little living room…. very handy!
				</p>
					<a href="http://www.plazasantarosa.com/"><h4>Plaza Santa Rosa </h4></a> <p>This is a budget hotel in the city centre, prices start from MXN 550 (USD 33) in double room or MXN 650 (USD 40) for 4 people. The downside is that it is the heart of a series of restaurants and bars so it might be noisy on weekends.
				</p>
				<p>
					In Cholula you will be able to reach many places by foot… at night we do recommend you opt for getting around by cab.

	<!-- Travel -->
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-offset-3 col-sm-5">
				<h2 class="subtitle"> Travel </h2> 		
				<h3 class="subtitle"> Which airport should I travel to?</h3>
				<p>
				“Mexico City Juarez International (MEX)” is your first option; you may also look into travelling to “Aeropuerto Internacional de Puebla (PBC)” but depending on the place you are travelling from it is less likely that you will find flights arriving there.</p>


				<h3 class="subtitle">Once in Mexico City, how do I reach Cholula? </h3>
				<p>Once you are at “Mexico City Juarez International” you can take a bus departing from the airport itself. You can take the bus either direct to Cholula (less frequent service) or to Puebla (more frequent service) to the bus station named “CAPU”. If you get the bus to Puebla you should take a cab to your hotel. It takes about 40-50minutes to drive from CAPU bus station in Puebla to Cholula. <br><br>
				The bus operator is “Estrella Roja” it takes around 2.5 hours to Puebla and it will cost around MXN 300 (USD 18).<br><br>
				<strong>Traffic Warning:</strong><br>
				Avoid travelling from Mexico City to Puebla state on Friday afternoon; the traffic would make your journey long and tiring. If you arrive on Friday to Mexico City you may want to stay that night there. There are many hotels around the airport: Fiesta Inn Aeropuerto, Ramada Aeropuerto, NH Aeropuerto, Courtyard Aeropuerto. All of these offer different budgets and they have shuttle services from and to the airport so you travel safely.</p>

				<h2 class="subtitle"> Other </h2> 		
				<h3 class="subtitle"> Cash vs Credit/Debit card </h3>

				<p>It is not recommended to carry large amounts of cash with you, a mix of pocket money and your visa/debit card is the best. Some banks ask for notice when you use your card overseas, make sure you let them know you are travelling to Mexico.
				For pocket money you can bring Euros or USD and exchange them in the airport, you will get the best rates there. You will need pocket money for cabs, some stores, and in craft markets. You can use your card in hotels, restaurants, larger shops, and malls.
				</p>

				<h3 class="subtitle">Taxis</h3>
				<p>A “safe cab” is always the better option in Mexico, do not take a cab in the street if you can avoid it. Your hotel or restaurants will have contact numbers for cab companies and they can order for you, you should also ask the hotel to confirm the price of the cab. If the restaurant cannot order one, they can direct you to where you can find a safe cab. Uber is also another safe option for getting around.</p>

				<h3 class="subtitle">Restaurants - Top food tips!</h3>
				<h4>Breakfast / Brunch </h4> 
				<p>1. Heuvos Rancheros – Fried eggs with tortilla and sauce (add bacon for extra deliciousness)<br>
				2. Chilaquiles con Pollo – You will have to have them and enjoy!</p>
				<h4>Lunch / Dinner </h4>
				<p>3. Mole Poblano – It is a spicy/sweet/chocolatey sauce made out of loads of different ingredients and spices, normally serviced with chicken<br>
				4. Cochinita Pibil – Slow cooked pork with spices cooked in a banana leaf. Normally served in tiny tacos with red onion and habanero <br>
				5. Molcajete con carne, queso y nopal asados – Beef, cactus, cheese and spicy sauce served in a hot traditional stone bowl (like a mortar bowl). You then prepare your own tacos with the ingredients in the bowl</p>

				<h3 class="subtitle"> Tipping </h3>
				<p>Tipping 10% in restaurants is customary, if you feel you received great service you can push it to 15%. The service would have to be really terrible not to tip.</p>

				Once in Cancun you can enjoy a couple of days in the Americanised city but the real adventure is in other places around the area: <strong>Holbox, Xcaret, Playa del Carmen, Chichen-Itza (Mayan Pyramids), Tulum, Laguna de Bacalar, and Celestùn </strong> are some examples.
